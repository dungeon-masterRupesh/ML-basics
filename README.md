# ML
This is my try to make codes regarding machine learning as a practice

# The PCA code was written by Sushant. I have developed the Kernel PCA part of the program
The KPCA_preimaging is actually a code developed by Quan Wang.
I have learned the code modified the imaging part to do pre-imaging of whole training data at a time.
His work and licence is present inside the folder.
I have also tried to do the same for my own data while varying parameters.
